No matter how determined a woman is to keep the spark alive, other
 things come into play (depression, work stress, motherhood, unseen
 episodes of <i>Project Runway</i>). The good news: Help is on the way.
 The better news: It's not coming from me (who has more questions than
 answers this month). It's from Leah Millheiser, MD, who runs the Female
 Sexual Medicine Program at Stanford University.<br> <br> Millheiser
 says that unlike in men, where the issue of performance is mainly
 related to blood flow to the penis, in women many factors—physical and
 psychological—can affect sexual desire and enjoyment. And although we
 gain confidence to ask for what we need as we age, our bodies change.
 During perimenopause, libido can drop and orgasms can become less
 intense or harder to achieve. Millheiser says you and your partner
 might need to revise routines that worked in the past to learn what
 works now.<br> <br> Another important thing to remember, she says, is
 that sexual problems are only problems if you're dissatisfied. Forget
 what you thought sex should be: Pressure to have sex a certain number
 of times a week, to conceive, to orgasm…any "to-do" in bed can make
 
 "doing it" a chore rather than a pleasure. "We want women to understand
 that orgasms are not the be-all and end-all of a satisfying sexual
 experience," Millheiser says. "However, if a woman is trying to have an
 orgasm but is unable to and it is causing her stress, that's when
 talking to a clinician may help."<br> <br> If any sex-related problem
 is causing you stress, talk to your gynecologist or ask her to
 recommend a sexual medicine specialist to determine whether your issue
 is physical or psychological. If it's physical (for example, pain from
 an STD or other vaginal infection, endometriosis, arousal or orgasm
 difficulties related to a chronic illness), a specialist should be able
 to help you. If it's psychological, your doctor might refer you to a
 sex therapist so that you and your partner can change patterns that
 aren't working. A sex therapist is not the same as a sex surrogate, by
 the way, so fear not—all you'll be doing is talking.<br> <br>
 
 Meanwhile, any age is a great age to strip off your sexual "shoulds"
 and remember that sex is play, not work. Maybe that's all it takes to
 bring back the fireworks.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span>
